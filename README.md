# Pollution in China - A Visualization

https://xh47.github.io/InteractiveGraphicsFinalProject/

This project is a thorough visualization to highlight the significance of a global issue. Pollution in China, as well as the world, is at an all time high, and this piece aims to capture the catastrophic increase of pollution. In northern China, air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels, principal coal, is causing people to die on average 5.5 years sooner than they otherwise might. Lung cancer is a widespread thing and only seems to get worse.
